                <p class="mainpara"> Hi I'm Mallory, I was born in North Little Rock Arkansas in 1994 and have lived all over the state since then. I was homeschooled for most of my life but ended up in public school in the 10th grade and finished highschool there. I have three siblings and am very close to them and the rest of my family.</p>
                <p class="mainpara">I have always had an interest in video game design and development but until recently I have never taken the steps to pursue any form of a career in software development. I decided to go with Lambda as an educational facility because not only does it meet my needs with an online education but also my work schedule. It also works well for me in the sense that I thrive in a peer to peer learning enviornment and actively having a community around me that can critique my code and help me get better for any future position I may have.</p>
